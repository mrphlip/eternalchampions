FM0: drum, 1 track, pan centre {{done}}
FM1: cymbal, 1 track, pan left {{done}}
FM2: rhythm, 1 track, pan centre {{done}}
FM3: multi
	* chords, 2 tracks, pan centre {{done}}
		* can use the same parallel-fifths instrument from Blade to pack this into 1 track
	* melody, 2 tracks, pan centre, has pitch bends {{done}}
PSG0+1+2: chords, 3 tracks, pan centre {{done}}
PSG3: snare, 1 track, pan centre, interleave with FM0 {{done}}

that's 9 tracks even with the chord packing
	* trying to pack the melody into one track would require samples for parallel fourths, thirds, minor thirds... and more? not viable
	* packing the PSG chords would require a bunch of different chord shapes, but since they're just square waves it could be cheap?
