FM0: Bass drum, 1 track, centre
FM1: Cymbal, 1 track, hard left
FM2: Bass, 1 track, centre
FM3: multiple
	* melody, 1 track, centre, has pitch bends
	* chords/rhythm, 3 tracks, centre
PSG0+1+2: more chords, 3 tracks, centre
PSG3: Snare, 1 track, centre, interleave with FM0

Need to pack PSG0+1+2 chords down to 1 track with square wave chord instruments again
Can mostly pack FM3 chords down with ec-fm-31-fifths.brr, too, except bar 40
	* that's a lot of instruments, but still fits within budget

1: FM2 bass
2: FM3 rhythm; bar 40: bottom of arpeggio
3: FM3 chords; bar 40: top of chord
