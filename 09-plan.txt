FM0: multiple
	* drone, 1 track, hard left
	* melody, 1 track, doubled note at the end, hard right
FM1: second drone, 1 track, hard right
FM2: drum, 1 track, centre
FM3: cymbal, 1 track, hard left
PSG0+1+2: wtf, 1 track (if there's doubles idc no-one will notice if I skip them), centre, w/ pitch bends
	* but, and I say again, WTF
	* highest note is a o6b, which is higher than AMK supports (o6a), need an 8va version of the square wave instrument
PSG3: snare, can interleave with FM2
