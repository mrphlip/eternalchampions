FM0: multiple
	* drone, 1 track, hard left
	* melody, 1 track, doubled note at the end, hard right
FM1: second drone, 1 track, hard right
FM2: drum, 1 track, centre
FM3: cymbal, 1 track, hard left
PSG0+1+2: wtf, 1 track (if there's doubles idc no-one will notice if I skip them), centre, w/ pitch bends
	* but, and I say again, WTF
	* highest note is a o6b, which is higher than AMK supports (o6a), need an 8va version of the square wave instrument
PSG3: snare, can interleave with FM2

0: FM0 drone
1: FM0 melody
2: FM1 drone + FM0 spare note
3: FM2
4: PSG3
5: PSG0+1+2
6: FM3
7: unused

On closer inspection, the PSG does have some repetition...

         1         2
123456789012345678901234
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNGHABCDEFGH

So:
	(1)[ six bars ]
	(2)[ two bars ]
	six bars
	(2) (1) (2)

still an absolute mess, and I'm gonna want to auto generate this I think
