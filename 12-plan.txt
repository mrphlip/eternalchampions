FM0: Bass drum, 1 track
FM1: Cymbal, 1 track, hard left
FM2: Bass, 1 track
FM3: String pluck, 1 track
FM4: Clicks, 1 track, hard right, interleave with FM1
FM5: Ting, 1 track, somewhat sparse, might be interleavable
FM6: multi
	* Melody, 1 track, has pitch bends
	* Bonus chords, 2 tracks, super intermittent, 21-24 and 53-56, must be interleavable
FM7: Melody mirror, 1 track, has pitch bends
PSG: multi
	* Melody mirror, 1 track
	* More chords, 2 tracks
PSG3: Snare, 1 track

that's way too many tracks, need to keep planning
* can theoretically interleave FM0, FM5, PSG3 into two channels with some shuffling
* FM1+FM4 wants to be a channel
* The melody is cloned on three tracks - combined instrument?
* The other two PSG tracks should be combined with psg_chords

Melody analysis:
* 5-6: triple
* 9-10: triple
* 13-14: triple
* 17-18: triple
* 21-24: melody on FM7, some bonus chords and another trill on FM6
* 25-26: triple
* 28: only FM6
* 37-38: triple
* 39-40: only FM6
* 41-42: triple
* 43-44: only FM6
* 45-46: triple
* 47-48: only FM6
* 49-50: triple
* 41-42: only FM6
* 53-56: melody on FM7, some bonus chords and another trill on FM6
* 57-58: triple
* 60-64: other stuff, but other tracks are quiet here so doesn't matter much
so only combined instrument I need is the triple
