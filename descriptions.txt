Name: Eternal Champions - Main Theme
Insert Size: 03E7
Type: Song (same for all)
Sample Usage: Many (same for all)
Source: Port (same for all)
Duration: 0:43
Description:
Main title theme from the Eternal Champions, a rather middling fighting game for the Genesis but with quite good music.

In the original game, this theme is noticeably louder than the other tracks... which I think is suitable for a main title theme, but if you wanted to use this as a level BGM you'd probably want to knock the volume down a titch.

Description:
Music for Trident's stage in Eternal Champions for Genesis. I'm pretty sure they made this one by hooking up a RNG directly into the sequencer and recording what fell out.

This is the one time I resorted to using code generation when porting this soundtrack. There is no "optimising" to be had here, only sadness.
